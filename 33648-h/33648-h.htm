<h2>THE MAMMALS OF WARREN WOODS,<br />
BERRIEN COUNTY, MICHIGAN</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Lee Raymond Dice</span></h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Few detailed studies of the mammal associations of the forests
of the United States have been made. But if we are ever to
know, for our different species of mammals, the natural environments
under which their evolution and differentiation occurred,
we must study and describe their habitats and habitat limitations
before all the native areas in the country have been altered
by the activities of mankind. As a contribution to this subject
the following paper is presented.</p>

<p>The Warren Woods are a state preserve under the Edward K.
Warren Foundation. They are located in Berrien County, Michigan,
about three miles north of Three Oaks. The preserve consists
of about two hundred acres, of which somewhat less than
half is in clearing and the remainder mostly covered by forest,
much of it still nearly in its primitive condition.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>&mdash;Sketch map of Warren Woods Preserve. The distribution of
the various mammal habitats is indicated.</p>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The topography is nearly level, though the area is cut by a
number of ravines draining to the Galien River, which flows
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 2]<br />[Pg 3]</a></span>
through the preserve. Along the river and in its bends there
are moderate-sized flood-plains.</p>

<p>On the flood-plains a few small buttonbush swamps occur;
and along the margins of the river a few freshly formed mud
bars have not yet become forested; but most of the flood-plains
are covered by heavy forest. The higher ground, except that
in the clearing, is covered by heavy beech-maple forest.</p>

<p>Several types of habitats are represented in the clearing: in
a few of the cleared ravines a thick growth of sedges and iris
occurs; on the higher ground small areas are dominated by rushes,
other areas by sedges, while the greater part is covered by grass.
In parts of the clearing blackberries and other shrubs have grown
up to form thickets, and in many places, especially along the edges
of ravines, second-growth trees of oak, maple, or beech grow
in the thickets or form small groves.</p>

<p>The mammal habitats found on the preserve may be listed
as follows:</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that all of the area in clearing and about
half of the forested area on the preserve has been and is being
heavily pastured by cattle and horses. The presence of stock
has changed the native conditions so much that, so far as interpreting
the primitive mammal associations is concerned, little
dependence can be placed on studies made in that portion of the
preserve. The grass and herbage is extensively eaten off, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
many of the shrubs and young trees eaten or badly mutilated.
Under the pastured forest little underbrush or herbage remains,
and the conditions are very poor for small mammals.</p>

<p>In all the forest, in the unpastured as well as in the pastured
part, a number of trees have been cut out in former years, and
although no trees are now being cut down, all the trees and branches
which fall are being cut up for firewood. This results in there
being few logs and little dead brush on the ground, and removes
a favorite place for small mammal nests and runways, as well as
largely eliminating as mammal food the insects and larvae which
are dependent on decaying wood. However, with the exception
of the removal of the logs and of a few trees, that part of the
forest to the north of the river is still in practically its native
condition, and it shows no evidence of ever having been pastured.
It is thus a splendid place for the study of the native faunal
conditions.</p>

<p>Although the whole area in the preserve is small there are
other areas of adjoining forest along the Galien River, so that,
for the smaller mammals at least, the results of the study and
trapping should indicate the primitive habitat distribution. The
relative abundance of the different species, however, is probably
much changed by the decrease throughout the whole region of the
carnivores, which have been much hunted and trapped by man.</p>

<p>The mammals of Warren Woods were intensively studied by
the author from July 3 to September 3 in the summer of 1919. A
camp was maintained near the edge of the Woods, and by trapping
and hunting every effort was made to determine the mammal
fauna of the preserve. From one hundred to two hundred traps
for small mammals and about twenty traps for the larger species
were kept constantly in operation. A small amount of trapping
was done in the fields and along the roadsides immediately adjoining
the Woods and a few records were secured from the camp
house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
    The work was supported by the Michigan Geological and
Biological Survey. Dr. Alexander G. Ruthven directed the work
and gave much assistance in securing the needed collecting equipment.
Much help was given by George R. Fox, Director of the
Warren Foundation, not only in getting to and from the camp
at the Woods and in numerous other courtesies, but also in information
about the Woods and about the mammals there. The
plant identifications were made by Mr. C. Billington.</p>

<p>The figures following the specific names in the lists of mammals
from each habitat indicate the number of individuals trapped,
shot, or seen and positively identified in that habitat.</p>

</div>

<p>Mink and muskrat are reported by residents to occur in the
Galien River in and near Warren Woods, but I was unable to
secure any specimens though traps were set for them; neither
did I see any signs of their presence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Buttonbush-swamp habitat</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis.</i> Northern white-footed mouse. 8.</p>

<p><i>Mus musculus musculus.</i> House mouse. 2.</p>
</div>

<p>A large buttonbush swamp occurs in the preserve just south
of the Galien River, but around this the native trees have been
cut away and over its accessible edges it has been heavily pastured,
so that it is not at all in its natural conditions, and it was
not trapped. In the unpastured flood-plain north of the river
there is another buttonbush swamp of several hundred yards
extent. This latter area was the one selected for study.</p>

<p>In this typical swamp the buttonbush, <i>Cephalanthus occidentalis</i>,
is practically the only plant present. It thickly covers
the area with its tangled branches, which grow to heights of four
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
to ten feet. The water had drained away in August, leaving the
ground bare, though still wet and soft. Under the cover of the
buttonbush there is no herbage whatever, and upon the ground
there are only a few decaying logs and a few small sticks, which
often carry a light growth of moss.</p>

<p>Around the edges of this swamp there is a narrow belt of
thick herbage, closely encroached upon by the typical forest of
the flood-plain.</p>

<p>Fifty mouse traps set in this habitat took eight northern
white-footed mice and two house mice the first night, August 5.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Shore habitat</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Procyon lotor lotor.</i> Raccoon. Tracks.</p>

<p><i>Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis.</i> Northern white-footed mouse. 1.</p>
</div>

<p>Along the shores of the Galien River a narrow strip of bare
ground was exposed in July and August. The ground of this strip
is mostly mud, but in a few places it is sand or gravel. Usually
the habitat is narrow, but in some places it is five to ten feet wide.</p>

<p>Tracks of raccoon were frequent on the shore along the river.
From a few mouse traps set on the bare mud shore one northern
white-footed mouse was taken August 4 beside a drift log.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Mud-bar herbage habitat</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis.</i> Northern white-footed mouse. 4.</p>
</div>

<p>A few small recently formed mud bars occur along the Galien
River in its outer bends. These bars have not yet had time to
become forested, and on their outer edges nearest the river there
is usually no vegetation, this part being included in the shore
habitat. On their older portions next the forest of the flood-plains
occurs a thick growth of herbs, several annual grasses, and
rarely a willow, <i>Salix</i> sp., or a seedling tree of white elm, <i>Ulmus
americana</i>, cottonwood, <i>Populus deltoides</i>, maple, <i>Acer rubrum</i> or
<i>saccharinum</i>, and others of the typical flood-plain species. The
vegetation during August is very thick, and reaches a height of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
four to six feet. The soil is either mud or in a few places fine
sand, and the ground is quite moist.</p>

<p>In this habitat four northern white-footed mice were trapped
August 3&ndash;4.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Flood-plain forest habitat</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Scalopus aquaticus machrinus.</i> Prairie mole. Ridges.</p>

<p><i>Blarina brevicauda talpoides.</i> Short-tailed shrew. 4.</p>

<p><i>Procyon lotor lotor.</i> Raccoon. 1.</p>

<p><i>Mustela noveboracensis noveboracensis.</i> New York weasel. 1.</p>

<p><i>Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis.</i> Northern white-footed mouse. 52.</p>

<p><i>Microtus pinetorum scalopsoides.</i> Northern pine vole. 5.</p>

<p><i>Mus musculus musculus.</i> House mouse. 2.</p>

<p><i>Sciurus hudsonicus loquax.</i> Southern red squirrel. 4.</p>

<p><i>Sylvilagus floridanus mearnsii.</i> Mearns cottontail. 1.</p>
</div>

<p>There are considerable areas of flood-plain along the Galien
River, and except for the recently formed mud bars the flood-plains
are heavily covered with a mixed forest in which the linden,
<i>Tilia americana</i>, white elm, <i>Ulmus americana</i>, and sycamore,
<i>Platanus occidentalis</i>, are conspicuous species. Under this forest
there are a few small trees, but there is very little underbrush.
The herbage also is sparse and, though in a few places there is a
considerable growth of ferns, grasses, and sedges, and of other
herbs, there are also many bare areas.</p>

<p>One of the significant features of the flood-plains, so far as
the mammals are concerned, is the flooding to which these areas
are subjected during the spring high-water. At that time the
flood-plain for a number of days or weeks may be covered with
several feet of water.</p>

<p>During the period between July 29 and August 28 a total of
one hundred and seventy mouse traps set in the flood-plain forests
along the Galien River took for the first nights' trapping, twenty-two
northern white-footed mice and one house mouse. Short-tailed
shrews, more white-footed mice, pine voles, and a jumping mouse
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
were secured on nights after the first. Larger traps took during
the whole period one raccoon, one New York weasel, and two
woodchucks. Several other woodchucks and a number of red
squirrels were seen. Ridges of moles were numerous, but no
specimens were secured. Tooth marks on an old, partly fallen
linden were probably made, perhaps a number of years ago, by a
porcupine.</p>

<p>Throughout the woods there are a number of small ravines.
These ravines are forested with trees mostly of the flood-plain
type, and there is evidence in many of the ravines, at least in
their lower parts, that flooding occurs in the ravine bottom during
the spring.</p>

<p>Fifty mouse traps set August 26 in a large ravine north of the
county road took on the first day five northern white-footed
mice and one house mouse. Short-tailed shrews, more white-footed
mice, and pine voles were trapped on following days. Here
also red squirrels and a cottontail were seen, and tracks of raccoon
noted. Evidently the fauna is the same as that of the flood-plain,
with which it is here included.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Beech-maple forest habitat</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Blarina brevicauda talpoides.</i> Short-tailed shrew. 7.</p>

</div>

<p>The climax forest of the region is dominated by the beech,
<i>Fagus grandiflora</i>, and the sugar maple, <i>Acer saccharum</i>. The
trees in this forest are very large, so that the forest crown is
high and the shade dense. Only a few small trees occur and
these are mostly young beeches and young sugar maples. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
underbrush varies much in height and denseness; mostly it is
quite open, so that one can easily walk through the forest, but
in a few places the growth is more dense. Common members
of the underbrush on the higher ground are the small beeches,
sugar maples, and the spice-bush, <i>Benzoin aestivale</i>; while on the
lower benches along the river seedlings of the paw-paw dominate
the undergrowth. The ground is heavily covered by decaying
leaves and a little dead brush and fallen branches, but nearly
all the logs have been removed. Early in the spring a thick
growth of herbs covers the ground, but by July the herbs are mostly
gone, only a few remaining, and there are many small bare areas
covered only by leaves. The soil under this forest seems to be
mainly clay; in spring or after heavy rains pools of water are
formed, and these remain for a long time.</p>

<p>Between July 21 and August 27 a total of two hundred and
eighty-five mouse traps set in the upland forest took on the first
nights one short-tailed shrew and thirty northern white-footed
mice. In addition to these species pine voles and a jumping
mouse were trapped on days after the first. One shrew was
caught alive August 30, as he was running about on the forest
floor at 7:30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> A few tracks of raccoon were seen from time
to time on the road leading through the woods. A few fresh
burrows of woodchucks were noted at the edges of benches and
of ravines. A few red squirrels were seen at different times and
two collected. Fox squirrels were rare, being noted only a few
times; Mr. Norman A. Wood also saw these squirrels on two
occasions in May. One cottontail was shot, in the climax forest.
Mr. Wood collected a chipmunk in the climax forest on May 15,
1918, and saw another in the same habitat in May, 1919.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Aerial habitat</i>:</p>

<p>Bats were seen on a few evenings, flying about over the climax
forest, and over the adjacent region, but they were extremely
rare, and efforts to shoot a specimen failed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>Small trees and brush have grown up along the edges of many
of the ravines in the cleared fields in and surrounding the preserve.
Many of the trees are oaks, but beech and hard maple also occur,
a few of them being relics from the original forest. Considerable
brush is present, formed by a large variety of species. A few
other small patches, especially in ravine bottoms and on flood-plains
have been allowed to grow up to brush and small trees. In
nearly every case these areas are heavily pastured.</p>

<p>The conditions here included in the second-growth forest and
scrub habitat are not homogeneous, but differ in each different
location where the habitat is found, tree and shrub species abundant
in one situation not being present in another. The habitat
is usually narrow in extent, being often confined to the width of
the steep ravine wall.</p>

<p>Owing to its poor development and uncertain characteristics
no intensive trapping was done in this type of habitat. A weasel
was trapped in open beech-maple-oak forest at the edge of a
cleared ravine, and a woodchuck was shot in the same type of
habitat. Another woodchuck and a skunk were trapped at
different times in low willow brush on the banks of the river just
north of the woods. Northern white-footed mice, Pennsylvania
voles, and a house mouse were trapped in thick oak brush and
trees alongside a road north of the woods. A red squirrel was
shot in second-growth oak and aspen woods in the north part
of the preserve, and they were seen in open woods along ravines.

Cottontails were noted a few times in blackberry thickets, in
brush in ravines, in clearings along the river, and in beech-maple-oak
forest along ravines.</p>

</div>

<p>A large ravine south of the river had been cleared of trees
evidently several years previously, and it has now grown up
mostly to sedges, grass, and iris in its more moist parts. Along
the little brook which flows through the ravine there is a fringe
of willows, and among the sedges a number of shrubs and small
trees occur, mostly thorns and a few young sycamores and black
walnuts.</p>

<p>Fifty mouse traps set in this habitat took on the first day,
August 16, three northern white-footed mice and three Pennsylvania
voles. More voles and a short-tailed shrew were taken
on later days.</p>

<p><i>Microtus ochrogaster.</i> Prairie vole. 1.</p>

<p><i>Citellus tridecemlineatus tridecemlineatus.</i> Thirteen-striped ground squirrel. 2.</p>
</div>

<p>In the shallow, poorly drained depressions of the cleared
upland the vegetation is dominated by rushes, which grow in
clumps and form a thick growth, reaching a height of about
one meter as a maximum. At the edges of the habitat and in
places not thickly covered by the rushes a growth of sedges, grasses,
and moss covers the ground; but under the thickest growth of
rushes the ground is bare and is evidently covered by water
during a part of the year. On this upland one small pond surrounded
by rushes did not dry up until late in August. In a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
few places small blackberry thickets occur in the areas of rushes
and dominate all other plants.</p>

<p>Fifty traps set in this habitat, on August 8, took on the first
night one prairie white-footed mouse and one Pennsylvania vole;
the prairie white-footed mouse was taken just at the edge of
the growth of rushes. Other Pennsylvania voles as well as a
lemming-vole, a prairie vole, and several young ground squirrels
were secured on later nights by the same trap-line. A skunk
den was situated in a blackberry thicket in the midst of the largest
patch of rushes.</p>

<p><i>Mus musculus musculus.</i> House mouse. 1.</p>

<p><i>Citellus tridecemlineatus tridecemlineatus.</i> Thirteen-striped ground squirrel. Burrows.</p>
</div>

<p>Sedges are dominant over a part of the cleared upland, occurring
on the moist gentle slopes which are too well drained for rushes,
but not in any numbers on the drier and higher parts of the upland.
With the sedges there are a few grasses, and the ground is sometimes
covered by a moss, but the sedges are by far the most abundant
plant.</p>

<p>Fifty mouse traps set in this habitat took on the first night,
August 15, one prairie white-footed mouse and one prairie vole.
Other prairie voles and white-footed mice were taken on later
nights, as well as one Pennsylvania vole and one house mouse.
Burrows of the thirteen-striped ground squirrel were numerous
in the sedges.</p>

<p><i>Cleared-upland blue-grass habitat</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii.</i> Prairie white-footed mouse. 12.</p>

<p><i>Mus musculus musculus.</i> House mouse. 1.</p>

<p><i>Citellus tridecemlineatus tridecemlineatus.</i> Thirteen-striped ground squirrel. 23.</p>
</div>

<p>The most widespread habitat of the cleared upland on the
south part of the preserve is the blue-grass habitat. In this
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
habitat the blue-grass, <i>Poa</i>, is the dominant plant, growing to a
height of usually not over 0.5 meter. With the blue-grass are
associated a few thistles, yarrow, and several other herbs. During
the whole period of my stay in the region, July and August, the
habitat was very dry, and the grass and herbs had mostly dried
up. This habitat and all the other habitats of the clearing were
being heavily pastured by stock.</p>

<p>Trap-lines totaling one hundred mouse traps, set on August 6
and August 18, took on the first nights two prairie white-footed
mice, one house mouse, and one young thirteen-striped ground
squirrel. More white-footed mice were taken on later nights.
Many ground squirrels were taken in larger traps at the
mouths of their burrows; most of these were young of the year,
and all of them were very fat in preparation for their approaching
hibernation.</p>

<p><i>Cultivated field habitat</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Scalopus aquaticus machrinus.</i> Prairie mole. 1.</p>

<p><i>Mus musculus musculus.</i> House mouse. 2.</p>

<p><i>Sylvilagus floridanus mearnsii.</i> Mearns cottontail. 2.</p>
</div>

<p>Cultivated fields occur throughout the region about the woods,
but the only ones in which trapping was done were wheat stubble-fields.
After the wheat was cut off these stubble-fields grew up
rather thickly to weeds. On the ground there were a number
of fallen heads of wheat and some shelled-out grain, furnishing
abundant food for mice.</p>

<p>Seventy mouse traps set in a wheat stubble-field just north
of Warren Woods, caught on the first nights, August 13 and August
29, sixteen prairie white-footed mice. Other white-footed mice
and two house mice were taken on later nights. Several cottontails
were seen in this field, and a few mole ridges were noted.
A prairie mole was taken by Clifford Reid in a grassy patch at
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the edge of a garden. In another wheat field the Helming boys
picked up a prairie vole.</p>

<p><i>Orchard habitat</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis.</i> Northern white-footed mouse. 1.</p>

<p><i>Microtus pennsylvanicus pennsylvanicus.</i> Pennsylvania vole. 2.</p>
</div>

<p>No especial study of the mammal life of the orchard was made,
and no intensive trapping was done in the habitat. However,
the orchard cannot be included in any of the other habitats recognized
in the region.</p>

<p>A northern white-footed mouse was caught alive by the
Helming boys in an orchard on July 16. A vole was seen to cross
a road in a small orchard on July 15; a trap was set and two
Pennsylvania voles secured, one a young of the year.</p>

<p>From time to time a few traps were set in the old farmhouse
and in the barn and other outbuildings of our camp. In these
buildings northern white-footed mice, Norway rats, and house
mice were taken. Several cottontails were seen in and under the
old barn. The Helming boys trapped a short-tailed shrew and
also house mice and a white-footed mouse in the basement of
their house.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Records of the Number of Embryos</span></h3>

<p>All the females taken were examined for embryos, and the
results are here tabulated by species and dates. The term <i>subadult</i>
is used to indicate an individual which has reached adult
size, but which is still immature as shown by the pelage, unworn

each individual the age is first stated, next the number of embryos
if any, and last the length of the embryos in millimeters measured
as they lie rolled in the fetal membranes. For embryos too
small to measure with field equipment the term <i>small</i> is applied.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">New State Record of the Prairie Vole</span></h3>

<p>The specimens of prairie vole, <i>Microtus ochrogaster</i>, listed
above from the sedges and rushes of cleared upland in the Warren
Woods preserve and from a nearby wheat field constitute the
first authentic record of the species from Michigan. The prairie
vole had previously been erroneously reported to be abundant in
Washtenaw County by Covert<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>, who evidently mistook the Pennsylvania
vole for this species.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Other Mammals of this Region</span></h3>

<p>The following notes on mammals formerly or at present living
in the region but not found by me in Warren Woods are based
mostly on information furnished by George R. Fox, Director of
the Edward K. Warren Foundation, and by William Schmidt, a
trapper and hunter.</p>

<p><i>Didelphis virginiana virginiana.</i> Virginia opossum. Three
were seen and one captured in Three Oaks in the winter of 1919&ndash;20,
and another was found in a granary on the outskirts of the town.
The previous winter one was shot just southwest of town, and
another was seen in a ravine north of Harbert. One was killed
in Warren Woods some time ago.</p>

<p><i>Condylura cristata.</i> Star-nosed mole. Mr. Hans captured one
four miles south of Three Oaks, near the Indiana line in 1919,
and brought the skin to Mr. Fox. One was taken by Dr. Parker
at Lakeside in June, 1919.</p>

<p><i>Ursus americanus americanus.</i> Eastern black bear. Formerly
occurred in the region.</p>

<p><i>Canis lycaon.</i> Timber wolf. About eleven years ago three
were killed from a pack of nine wolves at Lakeside. About 1910
a pack of eight were seen at various times during the winter on
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the marsh between Three Oaks and Galien. The following winter
the same pack, or another of the same number, was seen southwest
of Three Oaks, and four of the pack were killed just over
the Indiana line.</p>

<p><i>Vulpes fulva.</i> Eastern red fox. Common in the region. One
was killed in December, 1919, after having been chased from the
Warren Woods by dogs. Another was seen in January, 1920,
half a mile north of Three Oaks. In preceding winters a number
have been killed south of Sawyer where they evidently come from
the sand dunes.</p>

<p><i>Lutra canadensis canadensis.</i> Canada otter. Formerly
occurred along the streams, but are now apparently all gone.</p>

<p><i>Felis couguar.</i> Cougar. One was killed a few miles northeast
of Three Oaks many years ago. Another was killed near New
Buffalo in the early days.</p>

<p><i>Lynx ruffus ruffus.</i> Bobcat. One was killed a few years
ago near the Galien River a few miles northeast of Three Oaks.</p>

<p><i>Erethizon dorsatum dorsatum.</i> Canada porcupine. Found here
in the early days.</p>

<p><i>Sciurus carolinensis leucotis.</i> Northeastern gray squirrel.
Black squirrels were found in numbers in the early days.</p>

<p><i>Glaucomys volans volans.</i> Eastern flying squirrel. Said to
be common. A large number were seen by Mr. Schmidt on
one old stub in Warren Woods some years ago. Several were
seen in 1918 by Mr. Fox in second-growth oak woods in a little
ravine about one and one-fourth mile west of Warren Woods. One
was caught in Three Oaks in the fall of 1919.</p>

<p><i>Cervus canadensis canadensis.</i> American elk. One horn from
a large swamp in Berrien County is in the Chamberlain Memorial
Museum of Three Oaks.</p>

<p><i>Odocoileus virginianus borealis.</i> Northern white-tailed deer.
Formerly abundant in the region. Several molars were picked
up in Warren Woods.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Fossil Mammals of Berrien County</span></h3>

<p>The records of fossil mammals from Berrien County here
published have been collected by George R. Fox, who has also
kindly loaned from the collections under his care several specimens
for identification. Dr. E. C. Case assisted with the identification
of the mammoth teeth.</p>

<p><i>Mammut americanum.</i> Mastodon. (1) About 1897 the teeth
of a mastodon were dug up by a dredge within the village limits
of Eau Claire. Their disposition is unknown.</p>

<p>(2) At Snow, in section 36, Lake Township, a tooth was found.
This came into the possession of Frank Striker of Buchanan.</p>

<p>(3) A portion of a tusk and part of a skull were found on the
Beebe Farm near Baroda. These were sent to Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>(4) In the excavation of a ditch through a small marsh lying
near Bakerstown in Section 3, of Bertrand Township, the dredge
uncovered in the distance of between two and three miles bones,
teeth, and other evidences of six mastodons. Of these remains
the most important was a nearly complete skull with teeth in
place and disintegrated parts of the tusks. The skull was secured
by Dr. E. H. Crane, who restored parts, the tusks he did not
attempt to restore. This skull is now on exhibition at the Ward
Museum, Rochester, New York.</p>

<p>The skull lay about seven feet deep. It was under a bed of
matted oak brush on top of which lay a huge stone slab, estimated
to weigh two or three tons. Above was a layer of silt, then gravelly
clay; above were more silt beds, three in number. W. Hillis
Smith, who helped Dr. Crane secure the skull, furnished the above
information.</p>

<p>(5) On the Avery marsh, two miles east of Three Oaks, a
badly decayed mastodon skull and several teeth were excavated
in 1884. Dr. Bonine, Sr., of Niles, assisted at the excavation.
The bones and teeth were in the muck about twenty inches below
the surface. Other teeth, making seven in all, were found near
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the same place. Some of the teeth from this locality are on exhibition
at the Chamberlain Memorial Museum of Three Oaks.</p>

<p>In addition to the above there are several indefinite records
of mastodon remains from the county.</p>

<p><i>Elephas columbi.</i> Columbian mammoth. (1) One-half of
the tooth of a mammoth was found in the spring of 1917 on the
Beeson and Holden farm in Section 6, NE. &frac14;, Township of Galien,
by D. H. Beeson while cultivating corn. Two weeks later the
other half of the tooth was found. The specimen is now in the
Chamberlain Memorial Museum of Three Oaks.</p>

<p>The specimen is a well-worn lower third molar having twenty
ridge-plates, but some of the ridge-plates have been worn out and
lost. Seven and a half ridge-plates are included in a 100 mm. line.
The greatest length of the tooth is 280 mm. and its greatest
breadth 95 mm.</p>

<p>(2) A complete set of mammoth teeth with some portions of
the bones was found about the year 1900 on a farm two miles
southeast of Three Oaks owned by E. K. Warren. They were
discovered while digging post holes. The specimens are on exhibition
in the Chamberlain Memorial Museum.</p>

<p>One of the teeth sent us for identification proves to be a partly
worn lower third molar having twenty-four ridge-plates. There
are seven and a half ridge-plates in 100 mm. The greatest length
of the tooth is 350 mm. and its greatest breadth 95 mm.</p>

<p>(3) There is another record of a mammoth tooth which was
found at an unknown location in Berrien County. It was at one
time owned by Mr. Smith, who gave it to Dr. Crane. Its present
whereabouts is unknown.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
